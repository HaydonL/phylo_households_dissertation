This project contains the code used for my dissertation titled (INSERT).
(Give intro to project later - after writing more of dissertation)

## Structure

The structure of the project is as follows:

- data : contains the pairwise HIV transmission data and simulated data.
- helper-functions : contains a variety of helper functions used in R code.
- stan-models : contains the stan code needed to run the models.
- src : contains the source code needed to run the models and various other 
scripts such as one for simulating data from a Poisson Process.
- shell-scripts : bash scripts used for running code on the Imperial HPC.
- plots : dumping ground for plots for now. (messy)
- misc : redundant/unused scripts and some source material.
