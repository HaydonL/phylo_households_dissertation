# Infections by transmission type

We produce plots showing the posterior distribution of the proportion of infections from each group. The groups are:

1 : Female to male, out-of-household
2 : Female to male, same household 
3 : Male to female, out-of-household
4 : Male to female, same household

```{r}
# Extract rates (eta)
eta_draws <- as_draws_matrix(fit$draws("eta"))
eta_sums <- rowSums(eta_draws)

eta_prop <- eta_draws / eta_sums

# Plot histograms of proportions
for(group in 1:4){
  p <- ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(x = eta_prop[, group])) + 
    labs(title = paste("Histogram of proportions - group", group),
         x = "Proportion", y = "Frequency",
         caption = "For four chains with 5,000 iterations each")
  print(p)
}

# Print out summary statistics
print(summary(eta_prop))
```
We can see that the plurality of infections are M -> F and out-of-household. In
fact, a majority of cases are indeed out-of-household, though there seems to be
a considerable amount of within household transmission too.

As of right now, some of the parameters have a concerning Rhat value (but this
should hopefully change with ordered model, fingers crossed!)

```{r}
# Check proportion of HH vs OOH
eta_HH_prop <- rowSums(eta_prop[, c(2,4)])
summary(eta_HH_prop)
print(quantile(eta_HH_prop, c(0.025, 0.975))) # 95% CI
```

# Resulting densities

We now plot the underlying distributions for each transmission type for one 
sample from the posterior distribution.

(What is the best way to aggregate the samples? Perhaps generate densities for 
every 50 iterations and take the mean at each grid point for plotting? May be 
computationally expensive to take mean of all)

```{r}
source(here::here("helper-functions", "plot_normal.R"))

set.seed(635261)

# Randomly choose draw and chain number
draw_no <- sample(5000, 1)
chain_no <- sample(4, 1)

densities <- list()

# Plot densities for all groups
for (group in 1:4){
  cat("Plotting", group, "\n") # progress bar!
  density[[group]] <- plot_normal(fit, chain_no, draw_no, group, "not_in_use")
}
```

Compare to the results from the kde analysis:

# Diagnosis on ordered model

```{r}
fit_ordered <- readRDS(here::here("data", "logit_pairs_draws_ordered.rds"))
print(fit_ordered, max_rows = 200)


```


The first group seems to have a bit of issues with mixing, so let's plot their traces:

```{r}
# Plot mu_1 for group 1
mcmc_trace(fit_ordered$draws((c("mus_1[1,1]", "mus_1[1,2]", "mus_1[1,3]",
                                "mus_1[1,4]","mus_1[1,5]"))))
```

```{r}
#mcmc_hex(fit_ordered$draws((c("mus_1[1,1]", "mus_1[1,2]"))))
mus <- c("mus_1[1,1]", "mus_1[1,2]", "mus_2[1,1]", "mus_2[1,2]")
tmp <- posterior::as_draws(fit_ordered, format='data.frame') %>%
  setDT() %>% 
  subset(.draw < 500, select=mus) %>% 
  melt(.vars='.draw')
?melt.data.table
'.draw' %in% names(tmp)
  names(tmp)
tmp[,  cluster := as.factor( gsub('^.*([1-2])\\]$','\\1',variable) )]
tmp[, chord := as.factor( gsub('^mus_([1-2]).*$','\\1',variable) )]
tmp[, variable := NULL]
tmp
dcast(tmp, cluster   ~ chord + .draw , value.var = 'value')
```

```{r}
# Plot alpha for group 1
mcmc_trace(fit_ordered$draws("alpha[1]"))
```

Perhaps chain 4 is the issue?

```{r}
# Plot weights for group 1
mcmc_trace(fit_ordered$draws((c("weights[1,1]", "weights[1,2]", "weights[1,3]",
                                "weights[1,4]","weights[1,5]"))))
```

Probably still multi-modal, two main clusters. All chains identify the last three clusters to be undesirable. No idea why chain 4 suddendly stopped working in the middle.
